## Words pack rules

- Don't choose too long words - it's good to stay withing 12 characters.
- Using too many related words or words with similar meanings can make creating clues difficult - leave some space for clue givers.
- Each word should have 2 or more associations and can mean different things. Not just random words, as there are less associations.
